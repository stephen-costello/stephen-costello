I currently work as a senior software engineer in test working day to day with :

I have excellent planning skills and accustomed to latest software development methodologies, can work with pressure while remaining calm and effective and prioritizing wisely. 

I also have valuable transferable skills including analysis of data, attention to detail and risk whilst working towards goals and achieving results within tight deadlines. 

I enjoy motivating and being part of a productive team; equally comfortable working on own initiative.
 
I am ISTQB Certified and a certified SCRUM Master with excellent testing lifecycle skills (regression, functional UAT etc) and very strong automation capabilities across a number of languages and tools with an excellent track record on project results.
